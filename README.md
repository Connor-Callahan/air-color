# Air-Color

Click on any part of the sneaker to edit, then click the 'Color+' button to select a color from a dropdown to adjust the fill. Once a design has been completed, click the 'Generate+' button to generate a screenshot. The screenshot can then be saved with a user's name and shoe title. Here is a link to a demo of the front-end, https://air-color.netlify.com/.
